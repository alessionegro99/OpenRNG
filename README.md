# OpenRNG
Educational scripts on how to correctly use (pseudo) Random Number Generation with OpenMP.

Compilation is done as usual with `make`.

use `./<BIN> <N_TRIALS> <SEED>` in order to run the three different programs provided.

`pi` $\rightarrow$ serial Monte-Carlo estimation of $\pi$.

`pi_omp_naive` $\rightarrow$ naive incorrect implementation of OpenMP with RNG.

`pi_omp` $\rightarrow$ correct OpenMP implementation of Random Number Generation.
